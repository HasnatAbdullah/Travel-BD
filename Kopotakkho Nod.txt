                                                           Kopotakkho Nod
Kopotakkho River the pre-Dravidian term ‘Kabadak’ was transformed into ‘Kapotaksha’ [Kapotaksa] (meaning the ‘pigeon-eyed’) in Sanskrit. The river ichamati branched into two streams at Darshana in Kushtia district. One flowing southeast is known as the bhairab. At the south of Kotchandpur, an offshoot branches out from the Bhairab and flowing south meets with the shibsa near Paikgachha in Khulna district. This offshoot of the Bhairab is the Kopotakkho. Once upon a time, the water of this river was clear and transparent like the eyes of a bird. ‘Kapot’ means pigeon and ‘Aksha’ means eye.
The Kopotakkho originated from the Mathabhanga River with a great meander. A canal was dug to run the river along a shortened course avoiding the meander and the Kopotakkho got disconnected from the Mathabhanga. The Mathabhanga splits into four main channels-the Churni, chitra, nabaganga and kumar-within Kushtia district. The Churni joins the Bhairab, to become an important source of its Khulna-Ichamati branch. The Chitra flows south-southeast to Uzirhat, where it splits into two streams, the Khulna-Atari and the Chitra, the former joining the Bhairab north of Khulna town, while the latter joins it in the south. The Nabaganga is another decayed channel, navigable in the rainy season up to Magura. The lower Nabaganga channel takes much of the Gorai’s flow into the pasur. The Kumar, also called the Pangasi, branches from the Mathabhanga, 16 km from Alamdanga town, and flows southeast to a point 8 km north of Magura town, where it splits into two channels. One of the channels falls into the gorai, and the other joins the Nabaganga through the Muchikhali.
